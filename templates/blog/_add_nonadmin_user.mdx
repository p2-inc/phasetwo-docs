It is bad practice to use your Admin user to sign in to an Application.
:::

Since we do not want to use our Admin user for signing into the app we will build, we need to add a another non-admin user.

1.  Open the Admin UI by clicking **Open Console** in the Phase Two Dashboard.
1.  Click **Users** in the menu.
1.  Click **Add user**.
1.  Fill out the information for Email, First name, and Last name. Click **Create**.
1.  We will now set the password for this user manually. Click **Credentials** (tab) and click **Set Password**. Provide a password for this user. For our use case, as a tutorial, you can leave "Temporary" set to "Off".
1.  Click **Save** and confirm the password by clicking **Save password**

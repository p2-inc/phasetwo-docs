title: Dedicated Clusters
---

Dedicated clusters are available with paid plans. These Clusters use isolated compute, network and storage resources. Customers using dedicated clusters can create up to 20 Realms per cluster. If you need more, please contact your account representative or email [support@phasetwo.io](mailto:support@phasetwo.io).

For more information view the [Hosting](/hosting) and [Pricing](/pricing) pages.

## Migrating from a shared deployment

If you currently have a free, shared deployment, and you would like to migrate that deployment into your dedicated cluster, this can be done in a one-time operation. This is a batch operation, and will require 24 hours to process, so immediate migrations are not available. Please contact your customer success representative at [support@phasetwo.io](mailto:support@phasetwo.io) and indicate the deployment name you want to migrate, the target cluster, and the time you want to initiate the migration.

## Using a Cluster

Clusters are used much the same as our shared deployments. You can create up to 20 Realms per cluster.

## Creating Deployments in your Cluster

Once your Cluster has been provisioned, you can create Deployments as before, but you will open the create Deployment modal from the Cluster. Access to the admin console for those Realms is the same, using the _Open Console_ link next to each Deployment. Learn more about [creating deployments](./deployments.md)

## Billing

Access to invoices and ability to change payment information can be accessed in the action menu next to the Cluster. This will take you to [Stripe](https://stripe.com), our payment partner, to access your billing history and update your payment information. This is restricted to users with the appropriate organization roles.

## Deleting a Cluster

Clusters that have reached the provisioing or active state cannot be immediately deleted. If you wish to delete your Cluster and end your subscription, you can schedule the deletion. Your cluster will be available until the end of your montly billing period. At that point, there will begin a 7-day grace period where the cluster will be available, and a 14-day grace period where the data will be preserved. Following that, the cluster will be de-provisioned and all data will be purged from our systems for security and compliance reasons.

## Refunds

There are no refunds available for subscriptions paid on a monthly basis.

If you have paid annually, and you have more than one month left in your subscription period, you will be refunded a pro-rated amount following the end of the 14-day grace period. This refund will come through your payment method registered with Stripe.

## SLA

Please refer to our [Service Level Agreement](/company/sla) for more information.

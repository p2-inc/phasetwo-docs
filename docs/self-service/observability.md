title: Observability and Logs

Phase Two provides built-in observability features for your dedicated clusters. At present this is the ability to download logs for your cluster via the self-service dashboard.

Coming soon: ability to stream logs and export them to an external system.

### Accessing Logs

Visit your cluster's main page in the [self-service dashboard](https://dash.phasetwo.io/clusters) and click the **Observability** tab.

From here you can filter by time to the window you want to review and download the logs as a zip file.

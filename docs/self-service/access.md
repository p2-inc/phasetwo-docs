Enter an email or sign in with one of the provided SSO providers. The pathways this can take are:

- If you are **already registered with email** , you will be sent a magic link to your email. No password is stored.
- If you are **already registered with email** and then choose an **SSO provider** you will login via the SSO provider then be given the chance to link the two methods.
- If you are **not registered with email** you will be sent a magic link to your email to register and login. We automatically create your user when you provide an email that is not in our system.
- If you are **part of an organization** and your **email domain is associated with that team**, you will be sent to your team's IdP to finish login.

After your login is completed, you will see the **overview page**. This provides a quick launching point to your Realms, Clusters, or Team view.

Creating a cluster can be done through our [Dash](https://dash.phasetwo.io/) self-service tool or by contacting [Phase Two](mailto:sales@phasetwo.io) for assistance.

## Creating a Cluster

Creating a new cluster can be started in a couple of ways:

1. Visit the [create cluster link](https://dash.phasetwo.io/clusters/create).
2. From the [Overview page](https://dash.phasetwo.io/) and the [Clusters page](https://dash.phasetwo.io/clusters/), click **Create Cluster** in the top right.

At this time, only a Premium cluster can be created via self-serve, for Enterprise clusters, please contact [sales@phasetwo.io](mailto:sales@phasetwo.io). We will be releasing the ability to create Enterprise clusters very soon.

You must select a region, select an owning organization, and input a name to identify the cluster, and optionally provide a domain name you wish to use. Choose between Annual or Monthly billing.

Once you have input the required information, you will be sent to [Stripe](https://stripe.com), our payment partner, to set up your billing account and payment method.

Following successful billing setup, you will be returned to the [Clusters view](https://dash.phasetwo.io/clusters) while your Cluster is provisioned. This is usually fast, but can take up to 24 hours in some cases. You will be notified by email and in the [Clusters view](https://dash.phasetwo.io/clusters) when the Cluster is live.

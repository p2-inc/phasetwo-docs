title: Keycloak as a Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM)
---

## What Is CIAM?

Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM) is a specialized branch of IAM (Identity and Access Management) designed to meet the needs of customer-facing applications. Unlike traditional IAM systems that focus on internal users (employees), CIAM platforms manage and secure the identities of external users such as customers, clients, and partners.

The goals of CIAM are twofold:

- **Deliver exceptional user experiences** through features like streamlined registration, social login, and intuitive self-service account management.
- **Ensure security and compliance** through capabilities like strong authentication, data privacy, consent management, and scalable identity infrastructure.

Keycloak, as an open-source identity platform, offers powerful CIAM capabilities out-of-the-box, making it an ideal choice for organizations building secure and user-centric applications.

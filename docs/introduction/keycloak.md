Phase Two is based on the [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) Open Source Identity and Access Management system, built and maintained by Red Hat.

Keycloak has been battle-tested and hardened for many years. It's security and reliability is depended on by organizations from small startups to Fortune 500 companies and governments.

Phase Two is built as a collection of essential Keycloak extensions. While we endeavor to make Keycloak simple to use, operate and scale, we will maintain compatibility so that customers can always choose to migrate to their own Keycloak deployment. Our core extensions will always be open source.

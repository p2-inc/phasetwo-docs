Realm attributes are key-value pairs that can be associated with a realm. They can be used to store additional information about the realm that may be needed by your application or for other purposes. The ability to manage realm attributes is available in the Realm Settings tab of the Admin UI.

### Enabling Attributes tab

In order to see the Attributes tab in the Realm Settings, you need to ensure that you have set the Admin theme (Realm settings > Themes) to `phasetwo.v2`. Refresh the page after changing the theme and you should see the Attributes tab.

### Setting attributes

This is a simple key-value store but also very powerful. Make sure you are aware of the configuration changes that might override other existing configuration or have unintended consequences. 

### Useful attributes to be able to set

Some of the bundled applications can be configured using realm attributes.

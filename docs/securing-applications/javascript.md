Most modern applications are being built as single-page apps. The easiest way to secure these is with the JavaScript [keycloak-js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keycloak-js) library. If you are using a package manager like NPM, you can use it from there. If you are importing it directly, the library is served by the server at `https://{host}/auth/js/keycloak.js`

### Example

You must replace the `{host}`, `{realm}` and `{clientId}` values with those from your account.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://{host}/auth/js/keycloak.js"></script>
    <script>
      var auth = new Keycloak({
        url: "https://{host}/auth",
        realm: "{realm}",
        clientId: "{clientId}",
      });
      auth
        .init({
          onLoad: "login-required",
        })
        .then(function (authenticated) {
          alert(authenticated ? "authenticated" : "not authenticated");
        })
        .catch(function () {
          alert("failed to initialize");
        });
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="message"></div>
  </body>
</html>
```

A complete specification of what is available in the keycloak-js library is available in their official documentation https://www.keycloak.org/docs/latest/securing_apps/#_javascript_adapter

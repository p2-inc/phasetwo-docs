### Adding attributes to the token

It is possible to map all attributes of an organization into the access token, ID token or userinfo endpoint response using the **Organization Attribute** token claim mapper for OIDC. If you have users that will have a large number of organization memberships or attributes per organization, it is recommended that you only add the claim to the userinfo endpoint response, as it may cause large token sizes.

### API access

It is possible to get and update organization attributes using the API. The `attributes` object is a child of the `organization` object. It is a hash between attribute `name` and an array of `values`. They are read and updated using the organization [get](/api/get-organization-by-id), [create](/api/create-organization) and [update](/api/update-organization) methods.

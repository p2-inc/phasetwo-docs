The Organizations feature represents an significant enhancement to standard Keycloak that allows business-to-business (B2B) customers to better manage their partners and customers, and to customize the ways that end-users access their applications. Phase Two customers can use Organizations to:

- Represent their business customers and partners in Phase Two and manage their membership.
- Represent attributes and roles, unique to business customers and partners.
- Provide streamlined invitations to Organizations.
- Allow the self-management of business customers' Identity Providers and Users using our hosted portal and setup wizards.
- Build administration capabilities into their products, using Organizations APIs, so that those businesses can manage their own organizations.

### Creating and managing organizations

Organizations can be managed in the Admin UI in the **Organizations** section. It is possible here to create Organizations, and manage their attributes, membership, invitations, roles, and associated identity providers.

This feature will be available to Phase Two customers in the near future.

This feature will allow users to set limits on the number of requests that can be made to specific endpoints within a given time frame. This is useful for preventing abuse of the API and ensuring that resources are not abused, which could lead to service degradation or denial of service for legitimate users.

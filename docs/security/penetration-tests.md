Phase Two maintains compliance that can be reviewed at [trust.phasetwo.io](https://trust.phasetwo.io/). This includes a list of penetration tests that have been performed on our platform.

If you are a customer and would like to perform a penetration test on your Keycloak instance, please contact our support team. We will provide you with the necessary information and guidelines to ensure that the test is conducted safely and effectively.

It is against our policy to allow penetration tests on our shared clusters.

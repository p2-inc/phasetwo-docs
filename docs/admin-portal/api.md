If you choose to build functionality like the Admin Portal into your application to create a more unified experience, or to build it into native or mobile applications, you can use the APIs for User and Organization management.

- [Organization API](/api/phase-two-admin-rest-api)
- [User Account API](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/xgp/2d77cbebc6164160faae6aa77d127a57/raw/c51a2d44ef1ce2d176a0f0c53cde0183738045ce/openapi.yaml) - This is a undocumented Keycloak API. We have linked to an unofficial OpenAPI spec file.

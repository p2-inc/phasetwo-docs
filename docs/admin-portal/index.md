The Phase Two Admin Portal allows you to offer self-management of User Profile and Organization features to your customers from within your application with almost no code. A portal link can be generated in your application that will take a logged in user to the Admin Portal. The appropriate configuration to activate the Admin Portal are installed by default. You can customize style and visibilty of the portal using the information in the following sections

### Configuration

In the **Styles**->_Portal_ section of the admin UI, it is possible to configure user access to portions of the portal. This has the effect of limiting the self-management functionality that is available to your users. The sections that can be toggled are:

- _Profile_ View and edit profile information such as first name, last name and email. View and edit credentials, linked account, and manage authenticated sessions.
  - _Password update_ Update password.
  - _2FA create/update_ Add and remove 2FA mechanisms like OTP and WebAuthn.
  - _Device activity_ View and terminate active authentication sessions.
  - _Linked accounts_ View, create and remove links with social and other identity providers.
- _Organizations_ View and (conditionally) edit details of organizations for which a user is a member.
  - _Details_ View and edit organization profile information.
  - _Members_ View and manage organization members and their roles. Invite new members.
  - _Invitations_ Invite new members.
  - _Domains_ Add and verify email domains for SSO login.
  - _SSO_ Create and update SSO connections to organization identity provider.
  - _Events_ View events related to organization member activity.

#### Styles

Currently, the logo and favicon set in the general styles section will be used when rendering the portal in order to preserve your branding.

Additionally, you can override three colors used in the portal, and optionally override the entire CSS. See the [Admin Portal source code](https://github.com/p2-inc/phasetwo-admin-portal) for details for overriding the stylesheet.

### Access control

Access to components in the admin portal is dictated by the User's roles, both globally and within their organization.

#### Profile

Profile access requires the User to have the following `account` Client roles. These are granted to all Users by default, so you don't need to change anything unless you wish to revoke these roles. These roles can be managed in the **Users** section of the Admin UI by selecting the User you wish to edit and navigating to their **Role mapping** tab.

- Details - requires `view-profile` to view, and `manage-account` to change profile data
- Security - requires `view-profile` to view, `manage-account` to change credentials, and `manage-account-links` to add or change any social or brokered logins

#### Organization

Access to each of the Organization components is controlled by the User's member roles within the organization. There are no organization default roles, so you must grant these to Users after they are created and added to the organization. Member roles can be managed in the **Organizations** section of the Admin UI by selecting the Organization you wish to manage, finding the User in the **Members** tab, and managing their roles using the context menu on the right.

- Details: requires `view-organization` to view, and `manage-organization` to change
- Members & Invitations: requires `view-organization`
  - requires `view-members` to see members, and `manage-members` to remove or edit them
  - requires `view-roles` to see member roles
  - requires `view-invitations` to see pending invitations, and `manage-invitations` and `view-roles` to invite new users
  - requires `view-organization`, `manage-organization`, `view-identity-providers` and `manage-identity-providers` to use the SSO setup wizards and view/remove Identity Providers

### API

If you choose to build functionality like the Admin Portal into your application to create a more unified experience, or to build it into native or mobile applications, you can use the APIs for User and Organization management.

- [Organization API](/api/phase-two-admin-rest-api)
- [User Account API](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/xgp/2d77cbebc6164160faae6aa77d127a57/raw/c51a2d44ef1ce2d176a0f0c53cde0183738045ce/openapi.yaml) - This is a undocumented Keycloak API. We have linked to an unofficial OpenAPI spec file.

### Listening for changes

Once the user has made changes to their details, they seamlessly return to your application. You can be informed of changes by using [audit webhooks](../audit-logs/webhooks).

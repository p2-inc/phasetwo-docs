Per our commitment to keeping our core extensions [open source](/docs/introduction/open-source), today we're releasing our Keycloak extensions to the event system. These extensions form the basis of how our [Audit Log](/docs/audit-logs/) features are built.

<!--truncate-->

Additionally, we're providing several goodies that will be valuable to others building extensions on top of Keycloak, including a generic scriptable event listener, an event emitter to send events to any HTTP endpoint, a mechanism for retrieving event listener configurations from realm attributes, a mechanism for running multiple event listeners of the same type with different configurations, and a unified event model with facility for subscribing to webhooks.

We hope you find these extensions valuable, and we look forward to feedback and participation from both our customers and the wider Keycloak community.

The extension is available on GitHub https://github.com/p2-inc/keycloak-events

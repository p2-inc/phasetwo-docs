Phase Two is happy to announce that custom domains can now be configured via self-serve right in the [Dashboard](https://dash.phasetwo.com). This feature is only available on paid plans.

Custom domains are a key piece of branding and trust for your users. By using your own domain, you can ensure that your users see a familiar URL when interacting with your Keycloak instance.

Read more about how to set up custom domains in our [Custom Domains documentation](/docs/self-service/custom-domains/).

## Custom Domains Overview

Up until this point, custom domains were offered, but had to be setup and managed by Phase Two support. Now, you can configure and manage your own custom domains directly from the Dashboard. This allows for multiple custom domains to be used as required.

## Why Use Custom Domains?

Using a custom domain for your Keycloak instance provides several benefits:

1. **Branding**: A custom domain allows you to maintain consistent branding across your applications and services. This helps reinforce your brand identity and provides a seamless experience for your users.
2. **Trust**: Users are more likely to trust a familiar domain. By using your
   own domain, you can increase user confidence and reduce the likelihood of phishing attacks.
3. **SSL/TLS**: Phase Two provides free SSL/TLS certificates for your custom domains, ensuring that all communications are secure and encrypted.

## What's next?

Phase Two has many exciting features planned for the future. Stay tuned for more updates and improvements to our platform.

We recently gave a talk at the [Keyconf24](https://keyconf.dev/) conference in Vienna on how to extend Keycloak using its extensible SPI structure. In addition to showing what is possible and how to get started in building extensions, we also use our [Events and Webhooks](https://github.com/p2-inc/keycloak-events) extension as a real-world example. The hosts of the conference have posted the [video of the talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8u-QO02Qn8?si=OH6V1w564UysihSu) on Youtube.

Take a look, and try it out today with our [free hosted Keycloak](https://phasetwo.io/dashboard/) instances that run all of our [open source Keycloak extensions](https://github.com/p2-inc).

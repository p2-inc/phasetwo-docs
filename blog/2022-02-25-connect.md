Following our [post about our wizard product](/blog/wizard), we received an overwhelming amount of interest in it. Many customers of our cloud offering asked for it as a portal for their organization administrators to set up their identity providers. On-prem customers said that one consistent onboarding hurdle was SSO complexity, and asked for it to be included in the bundled distribution.

Today we're pleased to report that we've listened to both use cases and completed embedding the "wizard" product into Phase Two. We're calling it "Connect", as it's the best way we could come up with characterizing its simplicity. It massively reduces the complexit of configuring SSO connections, and distills the process into something any member of the team can understand.

Phase Two Connect is currently available by invitation only while we work out the final kinks. [Contact sales](mailto:sales@phasetwo.io) for more information.

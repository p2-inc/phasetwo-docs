As of today, weâ€™re thrilled to announce the launch of the **new Phase Two Dashboard** â€” a fully redesigned application for managing your Keycloak resources. This update goes far beyond a fresh coat of paint. We've rebuilt the experience from the ground up, introducing new capabilities, streamlined workflows, and deep infrastructure enhancements based directly on customer feedback. We've learned that the version of Keycloak we provide, enhanced by the Phase Two library of [extensions](https://github.com/p2-inc), solves for the 95% Saas use-case and this release will allow our users to better take advantage of those features. Some features are available today and others will be made available in the next few weeks.

## A Ground-Up Redesign

This isnâ€™t just a UI refresh â€” it's a completely **rearchitected application**. Weâ€™ve rethought every aspect of how users interact with Phase Two services to make managing Keycloak more intuitive, responsive, and capable. Whether youâ€™re deploying your first realm, spinning up your first cluster or scaling to serve thousands of users, the new dashboard is built to support you and your needs.

## Shaped by Real-World Use Cases

The first version of our dashboard got the job done, but it was intentionally minimal. Since then, weâ€™ve worked closely with our customers to understand what matters most. From enterprise SSO setups to custom themes and extensions â€” this release is a direct result of your input.

## A Powerful New UI

Weâ€™ve introduced a new, modern interface thatâ€™s faster, easier to navigate, and more scalable for the workflows you rely on. The redesigned UI improves visibility into your deployments and streamlines common tasks like adding users, managing themes, and scaling infrastructure.

Plus with this new UI, Dark mode is now a reality.

## Custom Themes and Extensions: Now Self-Serve

Launching soon, you will be able to **upload and deploy custom Keycloak themes and extensions** directly from the dashboard â€” no support ticket required. This makes it faster than ever to personalize your deployment or roll out new functionality.

## Built-In Observability and Monitoring

Weâ€™ve expanded observability features to give you deeper insights into your deployments. Track uptime, see logs, and monitor usage directly from your dashboard to ensure smooth, reliable performance. We'll be rolling out access to this over the next couple of weeks.

## Custom Domains (CNAMEs)

You can now **add and manage your own custom domains** right in the UI. Whether you're branding a login portal or separating environments, itâ€™s never been easier to configure.

## Integrated Team Management

Invite teammates, configure roles, and connect your identity provider â€” all within the dashboard. Full SSO support is available for securing team access with your existing auth infrastructure.

## Cluster Creation Across Regions and Tiers

Create Keycloak clusters with support for different performance and availability tiers. Whether you're running a dev sandbox or a production-grade deployment, the dashboard provides you with the tools you need to do so.

## Built for the Future

This release lays the foundation for rapid iteration. Weâ€™ve made it easier than ever to add new features, so expect regular updates as we continue to grow and improve the platform.

## We'd Love Your Feedback

Your input got us here, and itâ€™s what will keep making this platform better. Let us know whatâ€™s working and whatâ€™s not by emailing us at [support@phasetwo.io](mailto:support@phasetwo.io).

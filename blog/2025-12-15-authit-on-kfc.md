description: Phase Two's new hosting platform, Auth.it, was featured on Mr. Keycloak's livestream
---

Phase Two has recently [launched](https://auth.it/blog/welcome) [Auth.it](https://auth.it/), a modern authentication platform built for developers who want the power of Keycloak with the simplicity, polish, and developer experience of modern identity providers like WorkOS, Stytch, and Clerk — all at a fraction of the cost.

Last Friday, Niko Köbler (aka "Mr. Keycloak"), invited us to demonstrate Auth.it and explain how we built it on his livestream, [Keycloak Friday Chat](https://www.n-k.de/2025/12/kfc-keycloak-friday-chat-xmas-edition-authit-phase-two.html). If you're interested in an overview of the new platform, and would like to know the details of how it was implemented as a set of Keycloak extensions, please [watch the recording of the livestream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2thzEs35ws).

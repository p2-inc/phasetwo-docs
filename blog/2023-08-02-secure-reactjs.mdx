In this article we'll be using [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) to quickly augment an application with user management and single sign on (SSO) using the open source Identity and Access Management System (IAM) Keycloak for Authentication and Authorization. We will demonstrate the integration by securing a page for logged-in users. This quickly provides a jump-off point to more complex integrations.

## Setting up a ReactJS Project

:::info
We will use the Phase Two ReactJS example code here, but the logic could easily be applied to any existing application.
:::

1. Clone the Phase Two [example repo](https://github.com/p2-inc/examples/).
1. Open the ReactJS [folder](https://github.com/p2-inc/examples/tree/main/frameworks/reactjs) within `/frameworks/reactjs`.
1. Run `npm install` and then `npm start`. This example leverages [react-oidc-context](https://github.com/authts/react-oidc-context/tree/f175dcba6ab09871b027d6a2f2224a17712b67c5) (which uses [oidc-client-ts](https://github.com/authts/oidc-client-ts)) to provide hook and HOC support.
1. Open the `index.tsx` file. We will be updating a few values from the prior section where we set up our OIDC client. Taking the values from the OIDC Client Config section, set those values in the code.

   ```js
   const authServerUrl = "https://euc1.auth.ac/auth/";
   const realm = "shared-deployment-001";
   const client = "reg-example-1";
   ```

   Those are used to popluate the OIDC config

   ```js
   const oidcConfig = {
     authority: `${authServerUrl}realms/${realm}`,
     client_id: client,
     redirect_uri: "http://localhost:3000/authenticated",
     onSigninCallback: (args: any) =>
       window.history.replaceState(
         {},
         document.title,
         window.location.pathname
       ),
   };
   ```

   The config is then provided to the `AuthProvider`.

   ```js
   <AuthProvider {...oidcConfig}>
     <App />
   </AuthProvider>
   ```

   At this point our entire applicationw will be able to access all information and methods needed to perform authentication. View `Auth.tsx` for exactly how the code is authenticating your user. The sections rendering the "Log in" and "Log out" buttons are conditional areas based on the authenticated context.

   The logic using the hook to conditionally determine the Authenticated state, can be used to secure routes, components, and more.

1. Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You will see the Phase Two example landing page. You current state should be "Not authenticated". Click **Log In**. This will redirect you to your login page.

   :::info
   Use the non-admin user created in the previous section to sign in.
   :::

1. Enter the credentials of the non-admin user you created. Click **Submit**. You will then be redirected to the application. The Phase Two example landing page now loads your "Authenticated" state, displaying your user's email and their Token.
1. After your first log in, click **Log out**. Then click **Log in** again. Notice how this time you will not be redirected to sign in as your state is already in the browser. Neat! If you clear the browser state for that tab, then you will have to be redirected away to sign-in again.

## Learning more

Phase Two's enhanced Keycloak provides many ways to quickly control and tweak the log in and user management experience. Our [blog](https://phasetwo.io/blog) has many use cases from [customizing login pages](https://phasetwo.io/blog/customizing-login-pages), setting up [magic links](https://phasetwo.io/blog/set-up-magic-links) (passwordless sign in), and [Organization](https://phasetwo.io/product/organizations) workflows.

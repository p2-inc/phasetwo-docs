Keycloak and Frontegg are two prominent solutions in the identity and access management (IAM) space, each serving distinct needs. Keycloak is an open-source IAM solution with over eight years of development, known for its scalability and deep customization options, allowing organizations full control over user identity management. On the other hand, Frontegg is a cloud-native platform designed for quick deployment and integration, specifically tailored for SaaS applications, offering a user-friendly management experience. In this blog post, we will compare Keycloak and Frontegg based on cost structure, deployment options, customization, scalability, functionality, and support.

### Cost Structure

**Keycloak**
As an open-source solution, Keycloak is free to use, making it an attractive option for organizations of all sizes. While there are no licensing fees, organizations need to consider hosting costs and the resources required for system management. This cost model makes Keycloak particularly appealing for startups and enterprises that can manage their own infrastructure effectively.

**Frontegg**
Frontegg operates on a subscription-based pricing model, starting with a free 30-day trial that unlocks all features. Following the trial, costs begin at $499 per month for the Growth Plan. While it simplifies IAM implementation and reduces developmental burden, organizations must weigh the recurring costs against the value gained from Frontegg's streamlined user management capabilities.  
Frontegg provides a nice “free forever” tier that gives you enough to play with the platform. You would not want to use this for a production application with serious user covenants. To move upward, it is based on features and requires sales contact to assess pricing. While the next tiers allow for “growth to unlimited users”, pricing is heavily dependent on that usage.

**Winner**

Keycloak stands out as a more economically advantageous option, particularly for organizations with the technical capability to manage their own infrastructure.

### Deployment Options

**Keycloak**
Keycloak offers flexibility in deployment, supporting both on-premises and cloud-based solutions. This capability allows organizations to maintain control over their identity management infrastructure, making it suitable for varying operational requirements and compliance needs.

**Frontegg**
Frontegg is primarily a cloud-based solution designed for rapid deployment, offering a plug-and-play experience that facilitates quick integration into existing applications. While it doesn’t provide robust on-premises capabilities, it excels in cloud environments, catering particularly well to SaaS platforms aiming for fast time-to-market.

**Winner**

Keycloak offers superior deployment flexibility, accommodating both complex cloud and on-premises infrastructures. Frontegg, however, excels in ease of use for cloud-based deployments.

### Customization and Branding

**Keycloak**
Keycloak is renowned for its extensive customization options, enabling organizations to tailor authentication flows, user interfaces, and security protocols to meet their specific needs. Its open-source nature allows for modifications that avoid vendor lock-in, facilitating a user experience that matches organizational needs. While branding and theming Keycloak is possible, the current ability to do so is not straightforward. Phase Two has made this easier through extending the Keycloak Admin UI ([https://phasetwo.io/docs/getting-started/customizing-ui/](https://phasetwo.io/docs/getting-started/customizing-ui/)) which is available in all its [hosted](https://phasetwo.io/hosting/) offerings.

**Frontegg**
Frontegg also provides customization capabilities but focuses on delivering a user-friendly interface that prioritizes speed and accessibility. It allows basic branding and minor adjustments but may not match the depth of customization available in Keycloak. The branding tool built by Frontegg is well done and prioritizes the user experience.

**Winner**

Keycloak takes the lead in customization and flexibility, providing organizations more granular control over user interfaces and workflows. While Frontegg leads with providing the a strong user experience for branding customization.

### Scalability and Performance

**Keycloak**
Keycloak is designed for high scalability, accommodating large user bases through horizontal scaling and clustered deployments. This architecture makes it suitable for extensive enterprise environments that require robust performance under varying loads.

**Frontegg**
Frontegg is also built with scalability in mind, catering to growing SaaS applications through its multi-tenant architecture. While it's designed to manage increasing user volumes effectively, its performance may not yet match Keycloak's capabilities in extremely large-scale environments.

**Winner**

Keycloak is the preferred option for larger applications requiring robust scalability. However, Frontegg is well-suited for rapidly growing applications, especially in the SaaS space.

### Functionality and Flexibility

**Keycloak**:Keycloak provides a comprehensive suite of IAM features, including various authentication methods, fine-grained access control, and advanced identity federation capabilities. Its versatility in integrating with existing infrastructures makes Keycloak a powerful solution for complex IAM scenarios.

**Frontegg**
Frontegg focuses on user management, facilitating seamless authentication and role management. Its end-to-end user management platform integrates easily with existing applications, offering a robust alternative for companies seeking quick implementation without extensive customization.

**Winner**

Keycloak leads in functionality and versatility, offering a broader range of advanced IAM features, making it a better choice for diverse security needs. Phase Two can provide [expert enterprise help](https://phasetwo.io/support/), custom development, and migrations.

### Integration Capabilities

**Keycloak**
Keycloak’s extensive integration capabilities include support for various identity providers and protocols like SAML, OAuth 2.0, and OpenID Connect. This allows organizations to leverage existing systems while enabling seamless authentication across applications.

**Frontegg**
Frontegg also supports a wide range of integrations but primarily focuses on simplifying connections for SaaS applications. Its plug-and-play approach makes it easy to incorporate into existing products but may lack the depth of integration options available in Keycloak.

**Winner**

Keycloak emerges as the more versatile option, providing greater flexibility for organizations with complex integration requirements. Frontegg offers a great and easy interface to integrate with things they have support for.

### Community and Support

**Keycloak**
Keycloak benefits from a robust open-source community, with extensive documentation, forums, and active user contributions. Organizations can rely on community-driven support and resources to troubleshoot issues and share best practices.

**Winner**

Keycloak's established community offers a good way to get answers and help. Frontegg’s support channels are only available with the correct license. Phase Two helps to fill the gap between community help and Enterprise support ([https://phasetwo.io/support/](https://phasetwo.io/support/)).

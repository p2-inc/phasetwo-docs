We recently gave a talk at the [Keycloak DevDay 2024](https://www.keycloak-day.dev/) conference in Frankfurt on our [Organizations](https://github.com/p2-inc/keycloak-orgs) extension which provides single Realm multi-tenancy to Keycloak for modern SaaS applications. The hosts of the conference have posted the [video of the talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNq51wWw3F4) on Youtube.

In the ever-evolving landscape of Enterprise SaaS, navigating the complexities of identity and access management (IAM) can be a daunting task. As a startup striving for excellence in user experience and security, choosing the right IAM solution is paramount. Enter Keycloak, a powerful open-source IAM tool that not only meets but exceeds the demands of modern startups.

There are a glut of commercial startups that solve some of the core challenges of authentication and authorization. But most of them rely on obscuring their true nature as a _commodity_ as a way of _marketing_ their products as _somehow differentiated_.

The purpose of this series is to dive into the key issues that separate an open source solution like Keycloak from commercial entities like [Auth0](./2024-05-01-alternatives-auth0.md), [Okta](./2024-06-03-alternatives-okta.md), or [WorkOs](./2024-07-22-keycloak-vs-workos.md). This should give a startup engineer or manager ample background to understand the decision, and to cut through the marketing gibberish.

This series will address the following key issues in 4 parts:

1.  [Part 1](./2024-10-21-keycloak-for-startups-standards.md): Every commercial offering is an implementation of the same standards.
2.  [Part 2](./2024-10-28-keycloak-for-startups-data.md): The ability to control your data is essential, now and in the future.
3.  Extensibility and customization will always be necessary
4.  There is no justification for variable cost for individual features

Please stay tuned as we release a new section each week! If you would like to try out Keycloak, [sign-up](https://phasetwo.io/dashboard/) for Phase Two's free tier and test it out now.

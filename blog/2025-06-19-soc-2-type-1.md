## What is SOC 2 Type 1 Compliance?

SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls 2) is an industry-standard framework for managing and securing customer data based on five trust service criteria: security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. Type 1 compliance verifies that we have the right controls and processes in place as of a specific date.

## Why is SOC 2 Compliance Important?

- **Independent Validation:** SOC 2 compliance provides third-party assurance that our security practices meet rigorous industry standards.
- **Customer Trust:** Our customers can be confident that their data is handled securely and responsibly.
- **Risk Mitigation:** Strong controls help reduce the risk of data breaches and operational disruptions.
- **Competitive Advantage:** SOC 2 compliance sets us apart as a trusted provider in the identity and access management space.

## What’s Next?

We are already working toward SOC 2 Type 2 compliance, which evaluates the operational effectiveness of our controls over time. We expect to achieve Type 2 compliance within the next 90 days (mandatory audit period).

## What Does This Mean for Our Customers?

- **Peace of Mind:** You can trust that your data is protected by robust, independently-audited controls.
- **Transparency:** We are committed to maintaining high standards and keeping you informed about our security posture.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Achieving and maintaining SOC 2 compliance is part of our ongoing dedication to security and operational excellence.

Exploring Keycloak as an alternative to OneLogin for Authentication Solutions

Keycloak and [OneLogin](https://www.onelogin.com) (by One Identity) are both important players in the identity and access management (IAM) space, each catering to different organizational needs. Keycloak is an open-source solution with over eight years of active development, known for its scalability and customization. OneLogin, on the other hand, is a commercial product emphasizing user-friendly interfaces and extensive integration options. This article compares Keycloak and OneLogin based on cost, deployment, customization, scalability, functionality, integration, and support.

### Cost Structure

**Keycloak:**
As an open-source platform, Keycloak is free to use, making it a cost-effective option for businesses of all sizes. While there are no licensing fees, users must be prepared to manage their own hosting and infrastructure, which can incur costs depending on resource needs.

**OneLogin:**
OneLogin operates on a subscription model, with pricing starting at $2 per month per user for its basic services. Advanced features, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), require higher-tier licenses, which can lead to increased costs, particularly for large enterprises with many users requiring advanced security features. Further pricing is opaque and requires engaging OneLogin sales.

**Winner**

Keycloak is more economically advantageous and transparent, particularly for organizations equipped to manage their own hosting. Leverage Phase Two's [Free Hosting](https://phasetwo.io/hosting/) Tier to test and integrate Authorization and Authentication into an application(s).

### Deployment and Maintenance

**Keycloak:**
Keycloak supports on-premises and private cloud deployments. Organizations have full control over configurations, but they must also bear the responsibility of maintenance and updates.

**OneLogin:**
OneLogin is primarily a cloud-based solution but also provides on-premises options. It is managed by the vendor, meaning organizations benefit from automatic updates and less internal maintenance.

**Winner**

OneLogin simplifies deployment and reduces maintenance tasks for IT teams.

### Customization and Branding

**Keycloak:**
Keycloak allows extensive customization, enabling organizations to tailor authentication workflows and user interfaces according to specific needs. When unifying login from multiple systems to a single one, that means Keycloak and adapt and support as necessary. However, this level of customization may require more technical expertise.

**OneLogin:**
While OneLogin offers a customizable interface, its options are more limited compared to Keycloak. It focuses on providing a unified experience without deep customization. Specific business use-cases may not be supported.

**Winner**

Keycloak wins in customization and flexibility; OneLogin provides some simplicity without the ability to adapt to specific needs.

### Scalability and Performance

**Keycloak:**
Keycloak is designed to scale efficiently, accommodating large user bases through horizontal scaling and clustered deployments, making it suitable for extensive enterprise environments.

**OneLogin:**
As a cloud solution, OneLogin is also scalable, but is typically geared towards medium-sized enterprises. It can handle multiple applications but may not perform optimally under very high user loads.

**Winner**

Both will likely be able to scale, but Keycloak is the better choice for large-scale applications requiring high concurrency and user sessions.

### Functionality and Flexibility

**Keycloak:**
Keycloak provides a comprehensive suite of features, including diverse authentication methods, fine-grained access control, and strong identity federation capabilities (OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0, SAML 2.0). It allows for deeper integration with existing systems.

**OneLogin:**
OneLogin is built using Ruby on Rails and includes essential features such as SSO and MFA, using artificial intelligence to assess user risk scores, enhancing security functionality. However, it may not match Keycloak in offering a wide array of advanced features for complex IAM scenarios.

**Winner**

Keycloak holds an advantage with its broader range of functionalities and flexibility of integration.

### Integration Capabilities

**Keycloak:**
Keycloak supports integration with various Identity Providers and protocols, enabling flexible authentication across systems. It also has built-in support for many Social Identity Providers, like Google, Twitter, Facebook, Stack Overflow. These can be configured in an advanced manner.

**OneLogin:**
OneLogin features a well-developed library of pre-built integrations for third-party applications, providing a straightforward way to manage user access across different systems. It also integrates with HR systems and supports directory integrations, which can be particularly useful for SMEs relying on a variety of SaaS applications.

**Winner**

The choice depends on specific needs; OneLogin is easier for basic integrations, while Keycloak offers greater versatility for complex requirements.

### Community and Support

**Keycloak:**
[Keycloak](https://github.com/keycloak) has a supportive open-source community, with extensive documentation and user forums for troubleshooting and guidance. Phase Two offers [enterprise support](https://phasetwo.io/support/) for hosted and on-prem customers, or those with their own Keycloak deployment.

**OneLogin:**
OneLogin provides dedicated customer support, along with comprehensive documentation and professional services for additional assistance.

**Winner**

Keycloak’s community offers robust support for users, while OneLogin provides more direct, vendor-driven help.

### Which one is best for me?

When selecting an IAM solution, it’s essential to evaluate your organization’s specific needs. Keycloak is ideal for those seeking an open-source, highly customizable platform that can scale to meet complex requirements. In contrast, OneLogin is well-suited for enterprises looking for an easy-to-use, managed service with a focus on integrations. As one’s implementation grows in size, the cost may become too high to entertain.

Working with Phase Two provides some of the best of both worlds: easy integration with ability to scale without incurring additional costs.

In [_Deploying Keycloak on CockroachDB with Phase Two: A Complete Guide_](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/deploying-keycloak-on-cockroachdb-with-phase-two/), Cockroach Labs walks through how Phase Two and CockroachDB work together to provide a strong foundation for secure, multi-tenant identity at scale. The post outlines why strong consistency, high availability, and horizontal scalability are critical requirements for modern SaaS identity systems—and how combining managed Keycloak with CockroachDB meets those needs in production environments.

The article also includes an overview of Phase Two’s managed Keycloak offering, highlighting how teams can offload operational complexity such as infrastructure management, upgrades, backups, and high-availability configuration. By pairing this with CockroachDB’s globally distributed SQL database, organizations can deploy enterprise-grade authentication and SSO while maintaining strong consistency and predictable performance.

We appreciate Cockroach Labs’ collaboration and the opportunity to showcase how this complementary stack helps SaaS teams move faster without compromising on reliability or security.

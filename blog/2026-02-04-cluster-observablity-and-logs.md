We’re excited to announce built-in observability for dedicated clusters, starting with **log downloads** in the Phase Two dashboard.

Access to logs is essential for monitoring health, diagnosing incidents, and understanding performance. With this initial release, you can filter logs by time range and download them as a zip file for offline analysis. This helps teams quickly pinpoint issues and keep their services running smoothly.

Next up: **live log streaming** and **exports to external systems**, giving you more flexibility for centralized log management and analysis.

Learn more in the [Observability and Logs documentation](https://phasetwo.io/docs/self-service/observability/).

Ready to try it? Log in to the [Phase Two Dash](https://dash.phasetwo.io) and view logs for your cluster. This feature is included with all **dedicated cluster plans**. Questions? Reach us at [support@phasetwo.io](mailto:support@phasetwo.io).

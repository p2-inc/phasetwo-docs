In this article we'll be using [Keycloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) to quickly augment an application with user management and SSO. We will demonstrate the integration by securing a page for logged-in users. This quickly provides a jump-off point to more complex integrations.

:::info

If you just want to skip to the code, visit the Phase Two [Remix example](https://github.com/p2-inc/examples/tree/main/frameworks/remix). We also have a plain [React example](https://phasetwo.io/blog/instant-user-managemenet-and-sso-for-reactjs).

## Setting up a Remix Project

:::info
We will use the Phase Two Remix example code here, but the logic could easily be applied to any existing application.
:::

1. Clone the Phase Two [example repo](https://github.com/p2-inc/examples/).
2. Open the Remix [folder](https://github.com/p2-inc/examples/tree/main/frameworks/remix) within `/frameworks/remix`.
3. Run `npm install` and then `npm run dev -- --port 3000`. This example leverages [remix-auth](https://github.com/sergiodxa/remix-auth) and [remix-keycloak](https://github.com/marsmars0x01/remix-keycloak) to provide hook and HOC support.
4. Open the `app/services/keycloak.server.ts` file. This is a server only file. We will be updating a few values from the prior section where we set up our OIDC client. Taking the values from the OIDC Client Config section, set those values in the code. While it is recommended to use Environment variables for the secret, for the purpose of this tutorial, paste in the **Client secret** from the OIDC client creation section for the value of `clientSecret`

   ```tsx
    export default new KeycloakStrategy(
      {
        useSSL: true,
        domain: "usw2.auth.ac/auth",
        realm: "shared-deployment-001",
        clientID: "reg-example-1",
        clientSecret: "CLIENT_SECRET",
        callbackURL: "http://localhost:3000/auth/keycloak/callback",
      },
      async ({ profile }) => profile
    );
   ```

   At this point our entire application will be able to access all information and methods needed to perform authentication. View the `session.server.ts` file for additional information about how the `SessionStorage` is used. The `SessionStorage` stores the Keycloak token and is used to derive the authenticated state. View `user.tsx` for exactly how the code is authenticating your user. The sections rendering the **Log in** and **Log out** buttons are conditional areas based on the authenticated context. The buttons invoke server-side APIs provided by `remix-auth`.

   The logic using the hook to conditionally determine the Authenticated state, can be used to secure routes, components, and more.

5. Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You will see the Phase Two example landing page. You current state should be **Not authenticated**. Click **Log In**. This will redirect you to your login page.

   :::info
   Use the non-admin user created in the previous section to sign in.
   :::

6. Enter the credentials of the non-admin user you created. Click **Submit**. You will then be redirected to the application. The Phase Two example landing page now loads your **Authenticated** state, displaying your user's email and name.
7. Neat! If you clear the browser state for that tab, then you will have to be redirected away to sign-in again.

## Learning more

Phase Two's enhanced Keycloak provides many ways to quickly control and tweak the log in and user management experience. Our [blog](https://phasetwo.io/blog) has many use cases from [customizing login pages](https://phasetwo.io/blog/customizing-login-pages), setting up [magic links](https://phasetwo.io/blog/set-up-magic-links) (password-less sign in), and [Organization](https://phasetwo.io/product/organizations) workflows.

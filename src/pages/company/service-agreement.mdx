**5. DATA**

5.1 <ins>Data Transmission</ins>. We use commercially reasonable efforts designed to protect Your Data. You acknowledge that use of the Service involves transmission of Your Data and other communications over the Internet and other networks, and that such transmissions could potentially be accessed by unauthorized parties due to the inability to protect against all threats at all times arising from the use of the internet. You must protect your login name and password from access or use by unauthorized parties, and are solely responsible for any failure to do so. You must promptly notify us of any suspected security breach at [security@phasetwo.io](mailto:security@phasetwo.io).

5.2 <ins>Your Data</ins>. Your Data is your property. We use data in accordance with our privacy policy found at [https://phasetwo.io/docs/privacy](https://phasetwo.io/docs/privacy). You grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free license to use, copy, transmit, sub-license, index, store, aggregate, and display Your Data as required to provide or perform the Service, account management, account support, and technical services, and to publish, display, modify, and distribute de-identified information derived from Your Data and from your use of the Service for any lawful purposes, including, without limitation, improving our products and services, developing new products and services, and developing, displaying, and distributing benchmarks, analysis and similar reports, provided that we do so in accordance with all applicable laws.

5.3 <ins>Removal of Data</ins>. If Phase Two is required by any third-party rights holder to remove any data, content or information, or receives information that any data, content or information provided by or to you may violate applicable law or third-party rights, we may discontinue your access to such data, content or information through the Service, and/or may notify you that you must discontinue all use of such data, content or information, and to the extent not prohibited by law, you will do so and promptly remove such data, content or information from your systems. Phase Two may disable access to the applicable data, content or information or Service until the potential violation is resolved.

**6. CONFIDENTIALITY.**

6.1 <ins>Definitions</ins>. “Confidential Information” means any nonpublic information that a reasonable person would know should be kept confidential in light of the nature of its contents or circumstances of its disclosure. Our Confidential Information includes any usernames or passwords we issue to you or that you create, as well as the non-public aspects of the Service and any of our business, technical or financial information. “Disclosing Party” means the party disclosing Confidential Information hereunder, whether such disclosure is directly from Disclosing Party or through Disclosing Party’s employees or agents. “Recipient” means the party receiving any Confidential Information hereunder, whether such disclosure is received directly or through Recipient’s employees or agents. Confidential Information does not include information that: (a) is already known to the Recipient without restriction on use or disclosure prior to receipt of such information from the Disclosing Party; (b) is or becomes generally known by the public other than by breach of this Agreement by, or other wrongful act of, the Recipient; (c) is developed by the Recipient independently of, and without reference to, any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party; or (d) is received by the Recipient from a third party who is not under any obligation to the Disclosing Party to maintain the confidentiality of such information.

6.2 <ins>Requirement of Confidentiality</ins>. The Recipient agrees that it will use the same degree of care it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own confidential information of like kind (but not less than reasonable care) to: (a) not disclose or otherwise make available Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to any third party without the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party, provided that the Recipient may disclose the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to its, and its affiliates’, officers, employees, consultants and legal advisors who have a “need to know,” who have been apprised of this restriction and who are themselves bound by nondisclosure obligations at least as restrictive as those set forth in this Section 6; and (b) use the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party only for the purposes of performing its obligations or as otherwise authorized under this Agreement. The Recipient will promptly notify the Disclosing Party in the event it becomes aware of any loss or disclosure of any of the Confidential Information of Disclosing Party. The Recipient may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent compelled by law to do so, provided the Recipient gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of the compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted). The obligations in this Section 6 will survive termination and continue for a three year period thereafter, or if the information constitutes a trade secret, indefinitely.

6.3 <ins>Feedback</ins>. The Service may permit you to or you may otherwise submit feedback, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations, and messages relating to the use and operation of the Service. You agree we may freely use and exploit the Feedback without any requirement of confidentiality, other restriction or any duty of accounting.

**7. WARRANTY; DISCLAIMERS**

7.1 <ins>Limited Service Warranty</ins>. We warrant that Service will substantially conform to the written functional and technical service specifications we make available from time to time under normal use and circumstances. Your exclusive remedy and our sole obligations for any breach of the foregoing warranty is to the repair or re-perform the Service so that it complies with the foregoing warranty or for you to terminate your use of the Service. We are not responsible for any misuse of the Service or for any issues that arise from any third party product or service.

7.2 <ins>Warranty Disclaimer</ins>. EXCEPT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 7.1, YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK. WE DO NOT MAKE ANY ADDITIONAL REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF ANY KIND WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED (EITHER IN FACT OR BY OPERATION OF LAW), OR STATUTORY, AS TO ANY MATTER WHATSOEVER. WE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, QUALITY, ACCURACY, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH THE ENJOYMENT OF THE SERVICE. WE DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE SERVICE IS ERROR-FREE OR THAT OPERATION OR USE OF THE SERVICE WILL BE SECURE OR UNINTERRUPTED. WE EXERCISE NO CONTROL OVER AND EXPRESSLY DISCLAIM ANY LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THE RESULTS OF USE OF THE SERVICE OR DOCUMENTATION.

**8. INDEMNIFICATION**. You agree to defend, indemnify and hold us, our affiliate companies, and each of our respective directors, officers, employees, contractors, agents, successors and assigns harmless from any claim or demand, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of or relating to (i) any violation of this Agreement by you; (ii) Your Data or any other content or material you submit or otherwise transmit through our Service; (iii) your violation of any applicable laws or rights of another; (iv) your negligent or more culpable conduct; or (v) your use of the Service. We may, at our own expense, elect to assume the exclusive defense and control of any third party claim otherwise subject to defense by you. You may not settle or compromise any claim subject to this section without our prior written consent in our sole discretion.

**9. LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY**

9.1 <ins>Disclaimer of Indirect Damages</ins>. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL WE, OUR AFFILIATES, EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, AGENTS, REPRESENTATIVES, LICENSORS OR OTHER THIRD PARTY PARTNERS (“PHASE TWO PARTIES”) BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE, INABILITY TO USE, OR THE RESULTS OF USE OF OUR SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY; INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES RESULTING FROM PERSONAL INJURY, DEATH, LOST PROFITS, LOST DATA, LOSS OF BUSINESS OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, WHETHER DIRECT OR INDIRECT, ARISING OUT OF THE USE, INABILITY TO USE, OR THE RESULTS OF USE OF OUR SERVICE, WHETHER BASED ON WARRANTY, CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY. YOUR SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE FOR YOU TO DISCONTINUE YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE.

9.2 <ins>Cap on Liability</ins>. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL ANY PHASE TWO PARTIES’ TOTAL LIABILITY OF ALL KINDS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTY CLAIMS), REGARDLESS OF THE FORUM AND REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY ACTION OR CLAIM IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNTS PAID BY YOU UNDER THIS AGREEMENT DURING THE SIX (6) MONTHS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE DATE OF THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.

9.3 <ins>Exception</ins>. Some states or jurisdictions may not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability. In such states or jurisdictions, the MIME Parties’ liability to you shall be limited to the full extent permitted by law.

9.4 <ins>Independent Allocations of Risk</ins>. Each provision of this Agreement that provides for a limitation of liability, disclaimer of warranties, or exclusion of damages is to allocate the risks of this Agreement between the parties. This allocation is reflected in the pricing offered by us to you and is an essential element of the basis of the bargain between the parties. Each of these provisions is severable and independent of all other provisions of this Agreement. The limitations in this section will apply notwithstanding the failure of essential purpose of any limited remedy in this Agreement.

**10. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT**

10.1 <ins>Mandatory Arbitration; Exceptions and Opt-Out</ins>. You agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Service (collectively, “Disputes”) will be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights (the action described in the foregoing clause (ii), an “IP Protection Action”). You will also have the right to litigate any other Dispute if you provide us with written notice to opt out of arbitration (“Arbitration Opt-out Notice”) by email at [support@getmime.com](mailto:support@getmime.com) or by regular mail to 915 Broadway Street, Suite 112, Vancouver, Washington 98660 United States of America within thirty (30) days following the date you first accept this Agreement, or if you have not registered for an account, then within thirty (30) days following the date you first use our Service. If you don’t provide us with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice within the thirty (30) day period, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except as expressly set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) above. The exclusive jurisdiction and venue of any IP Protection Action or, if you timely provide us with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, will be the state and federal courts located in the Northern District of Georgia and each of the parties hereto waives any objection to jurisdiction and venue in such courts. Unless you timely provide us with an Arbitration Opt-out Notice, you acknowledge and agree that you are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class action or representative proceeding.

10.2 <ins>No Class Actions</ins>. Further, unless we otherwise agree in a writing signed by an authorized representative, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If a decision is issued stating that applicable law precludes enforcement of any limitations set forth in this agreement to arbitrate on the right to arbitrate claims on a class or representative basis, or as part of a consolidated proceeding, as to a given claim for relief, then that claim (and only that claim) must be severed from the arbitration and brought in the state or federal courts located in the Northern District of Georgia. All other claims will be arbitrated.

10.3 <ins>Rules</ins>. The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (the “AAA Rules”) then in effect, except as modified by this “Arbitration Agreement” section. (The AAA Rules are available at [https://www.adr.org/Rules](https://www.adr.org/Rules) or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Section.

10.4 <ins>Arbitration Process</ins>. A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. AAA provides a general form for a Demand for Arbitration and may provide a separate form for Demand for Arbitration for residents of a particular state, such as California. The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney licensed to practice law with at least 15 years of experience and will be selected by the parties from the AAA’s roster of arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.

10.5 <ins>Arbitration Location and Procedure</ins>. If you are a business, the arbitration will be conducted in Fulton County, Georgia. If you are a consumer, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of the documents that are submitted to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.

10.6 <ins>Arbitrator’s Decision</ins>. The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The arbitrator’s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator’s award of damages must be consistent with the terms of the “Limitation of Liability” section above as to the types and amounts of damages for which a party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys’ fees and expenses to the extent provided under applicable law. We will not seek, and hereby waive all rights we may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys’ fees and expenses if we prevail in arbitration.

10.7 <ins>Fees</ins>. Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, we will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).

10.8 <ins>Changes</ins>. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if we change this “Arbitration Agreement” section after the date you accepted this Agreement or access our Service, you may reject any such change by sending us written notice (including by email to [support@phasetwo.io](mailto:support@phasetwo.io)) within 30 days of the date such change became effective, as indicated in the “Effective Date” listed at the beginning of this Agreement or in the date of our email to you notifying you of such change. By rejecting any change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any Dispute between you and us in accordance with the provisions of this “Arbitration Agreement” section as of the date you accepted this Agreement, or accessed our Service.

10.9 <ins>Survival</ins>. This “Arbitration Agreement” section will survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement.
